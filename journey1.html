												<h3>Listen to the customer and always be ready to answer customer's question</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Before becoming the Switcher, I thought that serving customers was just talking and explaining. When I started my work, I found that professionalism and confidence were the most important part because customers usually have little knowledge about the product when they enter the store. I enjoy the moment that I passed on all my knowledge of Apple products to my customers and they also gave the greatest affirmation for my explanation which are surprised and started to operate the product by themselves. </p>

In particular, I was the Switcher that have the best performance in our outlet with excellent sales and working performance. Thanks to my PIC and Colleagues who teach me a lot.</p>

											<p>Customers switching to the new product might have concerns about learning something new. Their questions are great opportunities to show them features they will love and explain how easy it is to learn to use the new product. I need to learn many Apple services such as iCloud, Apple Music and some of the special functions of the Apple device, for instance, sidecar which can use the iPad as a display that extends or mirrors the Mac desktop. I need to always prepare and get to know about the product value such as privacy, the environment and accessibility are the core of everything Apple does. I believe that making products for everyone means designing technology that gives customers meaningful ways to express themselves. </p>
